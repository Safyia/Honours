# Introduction

With the recent rise of the social media everyone can easily share and access opinions, attitudes, emotions towards different products and services. It caused an increasing interest in several natural language processing topics, among them sentiment analysis, also refered to as opinion mining. Sentiment analysis is a field of study that examines these opinions using various machine learning algorithms. There is a high demand in different fields for the data acquired providing strong motivation for research. Companies can keep track of the popularity of their products among users, politicians can use peoples opinions to gain votes, and reviews help business organisations to improve provided services. In the past, surveys, polls or focus groups were needed to gain these valuable information, but automated sentiment analysis systems simplify the process and decrease the cost thus being more favourable.

# Development of Sentiment Analysis Field

Probably the first paper mentioning semantic analysis was in (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003), but the research on this topic was introduced earlier (Das and Chen, 2001; 2002; Pang, Lee and 
Vaithyanathan, 2002;) Since then natural language processing and linguistic became a very popular research topic due to the growing number of digital documents and the rise of machine learning methods and algorithms allowing to create widespread real-life applications. Large amount of papers focused on applications classifying documents as to their polarity - either negative or positive. However later work is directed more towards affect,  interpretation of metaphors and sarcasm, point of view, and related areas with the aim of increasing classification accuracy

# Existing Systems

There is a number of systems providing sentiment analysis of data from social network sites on different levels. Most of them are either very simplistic free to use web applications with few features and little accuracy or big expensive marketing platforms. To the existing systems belong the following examples:

- https://www.ubervu.com: apaid real-time social media marketing platform showing data visualisations and data statistics and including many other social media features
- https://www.viralheat.com : social media marketing suite that besides monitoring and analysing data allows collaborations, report creation or publishing posts directly to social networks
- http://www.socialmention.com : easy to use web application displaying positive to negative ratio that also provides analysis on strength, passion and reach. Data are gathered from several platforms including blogs and video. 
- http://www.sentiment140.com: very simple web application displaying  selected tweets with their classification and charts to visualise sentiment over a period of time

#Project Specification

The purpose of the project is to develop an easy to use solution providing data analysis and data statistics for Aberdeen City Council. The classified data will allow to examine areas needing improvement and show the changes in opinions over time. The final product will be an application with following main features:

- retrieval of targeted posts
- sentiment analysis of retrieved data
- intuitive dashboard interface for viewing data statistics

The social network Twitter will be used as a source of data for the informatian retrieval. This part will focus on index construction and efficient database creation. Data will be preproccesed and testing and training datasets will be created.

The sentiment analysis will compare different approaches and algorithms as well as address several sentiment analysis issues like sarcastic sentences. Solutions to optimise and improve the - intuitive dashboard interface for viewing data statistics

The sentiment analysis will compare different approaches and algorithms as well as address several sentiment analysis issues like sarcastic sentences. Solutions to optimise and improve the algorithm accuracy will be proposed.

The dashboard will provide an intuitive user interface enabling easy acces and viewing of the classified data. Users will be able to define a search to retrieve and analyse the desired topic. The UI will display the relative amount of positive and negative opinions along with charts and other statics.

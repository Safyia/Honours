## Deliverables

###Initial Project Proposal and Ethics Form.
- The proposal is a brief description of the project; one side of A4 is normally sufficient. This should already exist, since it will either have been agreed with a supervisor as part of a private arrangement or placed in the portfolio by the supervisor.
- The ethics form (see section 7) is a university requirement.
This deliverable is not assessed, but is compulsory and should be submitted on time. If the supervisor is not available to sign the ethics form before the deadline, please submit it unsigned.
Project Specification.
- The project specification is a more detailed description of the work to be done. Two sides of A4 should suffice. 
This should document the initial avenue of research / development which the student follows; indicate any prototype developments which are envisaged; suggest comparative studies of different design approaches etc. The initial project plan should be drawn up after a preliminary investigation of the literature. 
- This deliverable is not formally marked, but it will inform the supervisorâ€™s assessment of conduct. Failure to submit on time (without good reason) will have a negative effect on the conduct grade.
Progress Review.
- The major progress review is a report on progress to date, occurring midway through the project period. Typically one or two sides of A4. Must be signed by supervisor before submission.
